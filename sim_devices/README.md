# Cisco SSH Simulator Fleet

This directory contains tooling to spin up a fleet of Cisco-like SSH endpoints for NetAuto development/testing without using proprietary images.

## Contents
- `Dockerfile` – builds the simulator image (to be added)
- `cli_server.py` – custom CLI shell (coming soon)
- `entrypoint.sh` – container bootstrap script (coming soon)
- `commands/` – default command outputs (coming soon)
- `devices/` – per-device metadata files (coming soon)
- `docker-compose.cisco-sim.yml` – launches multiple devices (coming soon)

## Prerequisites
- Docker Engine 24+
- docker compose v2 (`docker compose version`)

## Usage (coming soon)
Instructions for building and running the simulators will be documented once the components are implemented.
